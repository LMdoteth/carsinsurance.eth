These benefits can include coverage for rental cars or transportation expenses while your car is being repaired as well as roadside assistance in case of a breakdown or flat tire.

However, it does not cover damage to your own vehicle. On the other hand, comprehensive coverage pays for repairs resulting from incidents such as flooding, hail, fire, animal collisions, and falling objects.

Most states require auto insurance, and failure to have it can lead to penalties like fines, license or registration suspension, and even jail time. Auto insurance offers peace of mind, covering damages and medical expenses for those injured. Liability coverage pays for damages to other vehicles, while collision and comprehensive coverage pay for repairs or replacement in case of accidents, theft, or other incidents.</a>
